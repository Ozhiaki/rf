//! Build-time fault-injection seam (probeability rule P-d).
//!
//! Compiled in ONLY under the `fault-injection` feature. The release binary
//! published to crates.io is built without it, so the seam is entirely absent:
//! no live trigger, no runtime branch, nothing an operator can flip. That
//! absence is what lets the release self-check report S-01/S-02/X-02 as honestly
//! not-applicable and X-03 (release posture) as pass.
//!
//! When the feature IS on, `RF_FAULT=<stage>` makes the named stage panic at its
//! seam, so the totality wrapper in `main` can be shown to convert a real
//! per-stage backend fault into a total error envelope (exit 3, INTERNAL, the
//! full seven keys) instead of an unmediated crash. A panic — not a returned
//! Err — is injected on purpose: the unmediated-crash path is exactly what
//! totality must catch, so that is what the seam must exercise.

/// The stages that carry an injection seam. The conformance verb folds over this
/// list, so adding a seam and listing it here extends the totality sweep with no
/// other change.
